Image Gallery

A minimalist, single-page image gallery was built as part of my learning process with Vite. 
The project focuses on clean layout, responsive design, and accessible image presentation using React.

This project shows my knowledge in setting up a React project with Vite.
Through this build, I strengthened my understanding of React with Vite fundamentals.

Other skills learned:
Implementing lazy loading for performance.
Deploying to GitHub Pages with a custom 404.html fallback.
Configuring vite.config.js for GitHub Pages deployment.
Using import.meta.env.BASE_URL for static assets.
