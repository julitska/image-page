Image Gallery

A minimalist, single-page image gallery built with React. 
This project features nine clickable images arranged in a responsive layout, 
designed to showcase clean structure, interactive behavior, and visual clarity.

This project showcases my ability to build a clean and responsive React layout.
Through this build, I strengthened my understanding of React fundamentals and 
making design decisions that prioritise clarity and user interaction.
